## About Us
Our motivation for this project originates from the struggles of the pandemic, which resulted in isolation, restricted social interaction and travel limitations. A consequence of this boredom and the ample time at our disposal paved the way for many new hobbies from fresh YouTube channels to exciting social media blogs. One of our friends in particular saw rapidly increasing attraction for her Food Blog, leading her to attempt to monetize her efforts to supplement her expenses. However, the lack of tools to assist young entrepreneurs was a challenge she could not overcome. This was when our solution, Jugaad, was ideated - a platform that allows new and existing businesses to go online with ease, providing them with outreach and online engagement to help accelerate their business. Jugaad, a colloquial Hindi term, is most commonly used to denote improvisation or having the presence of mind to come up with rapid solutions. Our solution too, was one such 'jugaad' - developing a fast work-around solution to assist a friend.


## What are we trying to solve
The UNSDG that our solution seeks to address is 'Decent work and economic growth,' (8) to achieve targets such as 'Diversify, innovate, and upgrade for economic productivity' (8.2), 'Promote policies to support job creation and growing enterprises' (8.3) and 'Promote youth employment, education, and training’ (8.6). Our solution aligns well with the goal to promote economic growth by empowering startups, businesses and entrepreneurs of all age groups - creating a space for innovation, diversity and economic productivity. 


## What is Jugaad
Jugaad, a colloquial Hindi term, is most commonly used to denote improvisation or having the presence of mind to come up with rapid solutions. Our solution too, was one such 'jugaad' - developing a fast work-around solution to assist a friend. While marketing the platform among our peers to assist her venture, we received comments and support that inspired us to take this to the next level. Jugaad is a unified platform for entrepreneurs of all ages and skill levels that allows them to easily start up an online business. Each business owner who registers on Jugaad has access to their own business webpage, which shows information about their company (contact information, connected social media platforms). Jugaad also includes a chat bot, Jugaadu, to help company owners get started by editing their banner page, business information and streaming platform. 
Based on initial surveys and feedback, both users and business owners agree that most platforms lack the ability to bridge the gap between customers and businesses when setting up online. Customers don't get the full experience of the products they are purchasing (via images) and business owners find it difficult to evaluate customer satisfaction. Keeping this in mind, Jugaad has given business owners the ability to showcase their products live on their home pages. The live streams are conducted via Twitch. Twitch is a popular live streaming platform with a large audience base, which can provide a greater outreach for new/small business owners. The live streams can be viewed either on Twitch or the platform itself, on the owners home page, allowing live viewers to donate to the owners. In addition to this, owners have the ability to post product ads, which are featured on the landing page for the users to view. This leads them to the shop page for them to deal with the owner.
